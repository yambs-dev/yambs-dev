- Hi, Iâ€™m @yambs-dev ðŸ‘‹
- I'm thinking about starting my own business based on a set of Azure based applications.
- So, Iâ€™m currently learning to build a development and than a production environment using Github, Azure etc.
- Since I am a business guy, I won't be able to do the development by myself. So Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Integration, Automation and Analytics development.
- You can get in touch with me through it@yam-bs.de.
